## Quick Start

Deep Thought is split into a number of individual components which interact with each other. The easiest way to get started is to use the [Amazon AMI](#amazon-ami) we make available with the latest release which includes a preconfigured Keycloak authentication server and MySQL database.

## Running

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Deep Thought can be deployed via a number of methods:
  - Amazon AMI deployment ([See Quick Start](#quick-start)
  - From GitHub Release artefacts
  - Compiled from Source ([See Building](#building))

### Amazon AMI

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Deploying using the preconfigured Amazon AMI is an ideal way to test Deep Thought.

The All in One image contains the following:

- `product-api-service` deployed at the path specified by the [Standards](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#uri-structure)
- `admin-frontend` attached to `admin-service`
- `admin-service` attached to a local MySQL database
- A Keycloak service configured for the `admin-service` and setup with a default username (`deepthought`) and password (`solongandthanksforallthefish`)
- An Nginx reverse proxy which has been automatically configured with a dynamically issued SSL certificate as a subdomain of `cdr.zone` (one of our domains)

#### Deployment

Our Amazon Marketplace entry, which makes things even easier, is currently awaiting approval however in the meantime you can deploy the public AMI `ami-0d0fe791606551e99` in the `ap-southeast-2` region directly as follows:

**Note:** In order to conduct SSL initialisation the AMI requires a Public IP to be assigned with Internet access.

**Step 1**

From the *Launch Instance* dialog within AWS find the current Deep Thought AMI (`ami-0d0fe791606551e99`).

<img src="/screenshots/step1-launchinstance.png?raw=true" width="800px"> 

**Step 2**

Select an instance type of at least `t2.small` type. Other instance types should function however small instance types will encounter performance degradation

<img src="/screenshots/step2-instancetype.png?raw=true" width="800px"> 

**Step 3**

Select Network details and **make sure** that *Auto-assign Public IP* is selected.

<img src="/screenshots/step3-instancedetails.png?raw=true" width="800px"> 

**Step 4**

Intialise a Root volume of at least 8GB

<img src="/screenshots/step4-storage.png?raw=true" width="800px"> 

**Step 5**

Add tags if desired

<img src="/screenshots/step5-tags.png?raw=true" width="800px"> 

**Step 6**

Initialise a Security Group with access to SSH, HTTP and HTTPS. HTTP is used for Letsencrypt SSL certificate initialisation and should be 0.0.0.0/0. For SSH and HTTPS you can choose to limit the IP range to your source address.

<img src="/screenshots/step6-securitygroups.png?raw=true" width="800px"> 

**Step 7**

Review your instance and proceed with launch making sure you choose an SSH key pair you have access to.

<img src="/screenshots/step7-instancelaunch.png?raw=true" width="800px"> 

**Step 8**

On first boot Deep Thought performs a number of initialisation activities associated with setting up a Root CA accepted certificate. Consequently initialisation can take up to 10 minutes.

**Step 9**

After obtaining the publicly assigned IP from the Amazon console and ssh to the IP using your SSH key and the username of `ubuntu`. On login you will be presented a message of the day containing the endpoint details. If the endpoint details still refer to `localhost` the initialisation has not yet completed.

<img src="/screenshots/step9-motd?raw=true" width="800px"> 

**Step 10**

Load the URL for *Deep Thought Administration GUI* and you should be presented with the Deep Thought themed Keycloak login. Login with the default username of `deepthought` and password of `solongandthanksforallthefish`.

<img src="/screenshots/step10-login?raw=true" width="800px"> 

**Step 11**

After logging in and changing your password you can now begin building out your Data Holder.

### GitHub Releases

*WIP:* We will release these soon. 

As a fast alternative to using the Amazon AMI you can download the GitHub Releases and run the components locally. By default the components are configured to use a H2 file based database (at `../localdb`) and authenticated via a registration enabled OIDC server hosted by [Biza.io](https://biza.io/) for our [DataRight.io](https://dataright.io) project.

#### Running

1. From the GitHub Releases page download each of the components comprising the release, currently this is `admin-service`, `admin-frontend` and `product-api-service`
2. For `admin-service` and `product-api-service` execute `jar -jar jar-file-name`, they are configured to operate on ports 8080 (`admin-service`) and 8081 (`product-api-service`)
3. For `admin-frontend` you will need to run this on a local http server. After extracting the zip file, `cd` into the directory and then execute your [simple http server of choice](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255). For example for Python 3.x enabled hosts `python -m http.server 4200` will result in a server available at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## Compatibility

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The Deep Thought project aims to be entirely compliant to the [Consumer Data Standards](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards). While we try to align our version numbers to those of the Standards unfortunately the DSB has chosen to use all of the *x.y.z* versioning of the semantic versioning scheme. Consequently the following table outlines the alignment between Deep Thought versions and the Standards:

Deep Thought Version                 | Release Date | CDS Spec Compatibility     | Notes                                                             | Status
------------------------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------
1.0.3-SNAPSHOT (**current develop**) | Regular      | 1.2.0                      | Snapshot Development Release                                      | Active Development

## Architecture

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Deep Thought is a combination of frontend and backend components, database storage and authentication clients designed to be implemented either all together or in a distributed fashion for production deployments.

### Components

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Deep Thought is comprised of multiple services designed for either self contained or complete Production deployment.

### Database Support

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Deep Thought utilises Java Hibernate for database operations. While it is likely that it can support any database Hibernate supports we currently test it for the following database architectures:
  - H2 Database using Local Directory/File storage
  - MySQL Database via Network

**By default** Deep Thought components will initialise using a H2 file based database located at `../localdb/deepthought`. Database access parameters can modified via a custom Spring YAML configuration file as demonstrated by the `spring-config.yml` [template contained within](https://github.com/bizaio/deepthought/blob/develop/ansible/roles/deepthought-service/templates/spring-config.yml) the Ansible component.

### Authentication

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Deep Thought uses OpenID Connect for authentication within the Administration interface. The Administration interface expects the authenticated user to be granted the scopes of `DEEPTHOUGHT:ADMIN:PRODUCT:READ` and `DEEPTHOUGHT:ADMIN:PRODUCT:WRITE`.

**By default** Deep Thought utilises an OpenID Connect server hosted by DataRight.io. While no warranty is implied for this server we have enabled User Registration for this realm to ease testing Deep Thought locally. As with database configuration it is possible to alter the JWKS endpoint used by utilising a custom Spring config as demonstrated within the Ansible rules for [Spring Configuration](https://github.com/bizaio/deepthought/blob/develop/ansible/roles/deepthought-service/templates/spring-config.yml) and by deploying a custom `config.json` within the Admin Frontend in `assets/config.json` as demonstrated in the Ansible rules for [deepthought-frontend](https://github.com/bizaio/deepthought/blob/develop/ansible/roles/deepthought-frontend/templates/config.json).

## Production Deployment

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Deep Thought is specifically built to be deployed within Production like environments. This means that it deliberately isolates individual components and, where relevent, assumes that certain components will be deployed in separate security zones from others. While we are still putting together some more indepth documentation around these deployment methodologies at a bare minimum we **recommend** the following:

1. Deployment of `admin-service` and `admin-frontend` should occur in a protected security environment with an internal OIDC server
2. `product-api-service` should be deployed behind an API Gateway (typically in reverse proxy configuration)
3. Databases should be configured in a Master for `admin-service` access and Read-Only Replica for `product-api-service`

If you are considering deploying `Deep Thought` into production we encourage you to contact us by [email](mailto:hello@biza.io).
